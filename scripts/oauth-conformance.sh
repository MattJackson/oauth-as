# oauth-conformance.sh - runs the INDEPENDENT OAuth 2.1 conformance harness
# (crates/oauth-as-conformance) against the live AS (crates/oauth-as) as a black box.
#
# Modes:
#   --selftest   Prove the gate can go RED before anyone trusts a green (house discipline:
#                a check is not trusted until it has been shown red first):
#                  RED-A   the hermetic RFC-vector suite MUST FAIL when the expected PKCE
#                          challenge is deliberately corrupted via
#                          OAUTH_CONFORMANCE_SELFTEST_BREAK=pkce;
#                  GREEN-A the same suite MUST PASS clean;
#                  RED-B   the black-box suite MUST FAIL against a deliberately
#                          nonconformant stub AS (a python http server whose RFC 8414
#                          metadata document is an empty JSON object).
#   --check      Run the real thing: start the AS over HTTP, wait for its RFC 8414 metadata,
#                run the black-box + third-party-client suites against it. FAILS LOUDLY
#                (exit 1 with a clear message) when the AS cannot be served; this gate must
#                never pass vacuously.
#
# AS launch contract (assumptions are documented in crates/oauth-as-conformance/src/lib.rs):
#   crates/oauth-as is a LIBRARY with no binary, so serving it requires an executable
#   crates/oauth-as/conformance-serve.sh, which must:
#   * serve HTTP on the address in OAUTH_AS_ADDR (we use 127.0.0.1:8914) and block until
#     killed;
#   * honor OAUTH_AS_CONFORMANCE_SEED=1 by seeding the deterministic conformance clients and
#     auto-approval behavior described in crates/oauth-as-conformance/src/lib.rs.
#   That shim EXISTS (crates/oauth-as/conformance-serve.sh) and is executable. The `-x` check
#   below still gates on its presence rather than assuming it, so a tree that loses it fails
#   loudly rather than passing vacuously.
#
# Backgrounded servers ALWAYS get their stdout/stderr redirected to a log file, never
# captured via command substitution (a hard-won lesson: substitution hangs until the
# backgrounded child closes its inherited stdout).
